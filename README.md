# exchange-screen

## Disclaimer

In my daily work I practically use Redux for state management tasks. But this test task gave me an opportunity to try
something new. So I decided to build this application using Apollo as a graphql client.

Also, in the latest release of Apollo was presented an ability to use it as a local state manager.
Well, now  the results of my experiment)

## Run the application

Requirements: node js >= 8.9.0 & npm >= 5.7.1 (I tested this application on this environment)

`npm i`

`npm run start`

And just open [link in you browser](http://localhost:8080/exchange)

 Notice!

 Start command allows us to run application with mocks. I used response format for currency rates provided by
 [ openexchange service](https://openexchangerates.org/).

 If the real service call required, let me know about it)
